### 🧠 A Bit More About Me:

I'm passionate about **tech for social good**, **accessible tech**, **disability inclusion**, and how we can use **AI ethically** to empower communities. Whether it’s building a nonprofit, diving into HCI research, or mentoring women in STEM — I believe tech should *always* include a human story. I believe in **designing for empathy** and building with purpose.

📢 Strong advocate for disability visibility through my nonprofit [Disability Visibility India](https://www.instagram.com/disabilityvisibilityindia/)

> “Tech should serve people — not the other way around.”
